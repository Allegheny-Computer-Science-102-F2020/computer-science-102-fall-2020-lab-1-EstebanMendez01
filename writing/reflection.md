# Reflection by Esteban Mendez

## Using a fenced code block, please display the correct output from running your program

TODO: Add a fenced code block that gives the output from running the program

## For each terminal window command, add an explanation to the following list

- `python3 src/display_course_name.py`: That you want to run an specific python program, in this case the program that wants to be run is on an specific folder, src.

- `git commit`: Describe a multi-step process in which a command is being done.

- `gradle grade`: Check grades of a specific folder or repository, in this case it is being checked about all the lab folders.

## What was the greatest technical challenge that you faced and how did you overcome it?

The greatest technical challenge that I faced was that the program was not working and it was not letting me do the ssh key and to add it to the VS Code, so what I di dis to reach out to a Technical Leader to help me solve my problem, but before that I searched of what may the problem be. Finally We solved it by just moving the folder and put it in a spot that the computer has access to.

## After completing this assignment, what is task that you want to practice more? Why?

The task I want to practice more is the fact of using git, since I never used it before I need to get used to it. It is a great resource, because you use it for everything, like cloning, commiting, pushing, which is important to have the things up to date. This task is very important, because I will be using it a lot of time within the course and when I am using GitHub and Git.

## After completing this assignment, what is one experience for which you are grateful?

The experience for which I am grateful is the fact of learning how to use git and VS Code with live share, because it is a very useful tool I can use in the future. I am grateful too that I have managed to solve my problems encountered and that I need to persistent in keep trying to achieve what I achieved here. This would help me to use this programs in the future and code with my friends or coworkers I know and want to start a new project.
