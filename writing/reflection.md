## For each terminal window command, add an explanation to the following list

- `python3 src/display_course_name.py`: That you want to open an specific python program. 
- `git commit`: Describe a multi-step process in which a command is being done. 
- `gradle grade`: Check grades of a specific folder or repository.

## What was the greatest technical challenge that you faced and how did you overcome it?

The greatest technical challenge that I faced was that the program was not working and it was not letting me do the ssh key and to add it to the VS Code, so what I di dis to reach out to a Technical Leader to help me solve my problem, but before that I searched of what may the problem be. Finally We solved it by just moving the folder and put it in a spot that the computer has access to. 

## After completing this assignment, what is task that you want to practice more? Why?

The task I want to practice more is the fact of using git, since I never used it before I need to get used to it. It is a great resource, because you use it for everything, like cloning, commiting, pushign, which is important to have the things up to date.

## After completing this assignment, what is one experience for which you are grateful?

The experience for which I am grateful is the fact of learning how to use git and VS Code with live share, because it is a very useful tool I can use in the future.
